# Transformer  
  
## Outline
In this repo, I will show  
1. How to code transformer model in pytorch
2. How to train the pytorch transformer model
3. How to train transformer model through huggingface  
  
## Example  
*  `pytorch_transfomer.py`: show how to code, train and inference the pytorch transformer model; show how to plot loss curve by `matplotlib` and tensorboard.  

## Todo  
- [ ] train transformer model through huggingface
